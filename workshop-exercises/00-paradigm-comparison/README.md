# Programming Paradigm Comparison

## Overview

Four code examples that demonstrate different programming paradigm combinations. Each processes the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to calculate sum and count of even numbers.

## Key Differences

### 1. Procedural & Imperative

- **PROCEDURAL**: No relationship between state and functions/behaviour & modify state
- **IMPERATIVE**: Mutate state

### 2. Procedural & Functional

- **PROCEDURAL**: No relationship between state and functions/behaviour
- **FUNCTIONAL**: No state mutations

### 3. Object-oriented & Imperative

- **OBJECT-ORIENTED**: State is separated in units
- **IMPERATIVE**: Mutate state

### 4. Object-oriented & Functional

- **OBJECT-ORIENTED**: State is separated in units
- **FUNCTIONAL**: No state mutations
